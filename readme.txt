Replaces all mentions of Donald Trump on your website with Donald Drumpf.

== Description ==

While sources agree that Drumpf is the ancestral name of Trump, and that neither Donald Trump nor his father were named Drumpf, they disagree on when the family name was changed, whether in the 17th century or 1885. But who cares when that happened exactly. We're just trying to make Donald Drumpf again.
